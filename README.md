# didactic-tribble
Just a super simple Chrome extension I made as a learning opportunity. Inspired by the randomly generated GitHub repo name.

## Installation
This is the unpacked source of the extension. To install clone or download this repository to a directory on your computer. In Chrome open a tab and browse to chrome://extensions. Select 'Developer Mode' in the upper right to see the developer options. Now chose the 'Load Unpacked Extension...' button and select the directory where you save the file. You should now see the Tribble icon in your browser bar.

## Usage
Click the tribble, get a gif of Tribbles falling on Kirk. That's it. Told you it was super simple. 

## Alternate Usage
Starting at [Chrome's Getting Started Tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) use this simple project as a stepping stone to bigger ideas. Have fun with it.
